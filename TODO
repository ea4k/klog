RC-BUGS:
Bug to confirm: TX_freq is not saved on new QSO
Bug to confirm: TX_freq is not modified when editing a QSO.
Bug to confirm: TX & RX freq  are not cleased when clear button is clicked.

In searchwidget:
void showQSO(const int _q);
I need to receive the id and show the QSO in the table



Check-BUG: freq can not be typed
Check-BUG: band can't be selected (or it always goes back to 160 even if not seected)

For next release:
TODO: - Check if the save to adif on exit is working properly

TODO: Import LOTW (MainWindow::slotADIFImport)
TODO: Remove the Querys from void SetupPageLogs::

Working:
TODO: ADD A TIP ON the DXCC tab stating Prefix, CQ, ITU & Bearing


SAT DB: https://db.satnogs.org/api/

This is a kind of roadmap for KLog development.
It is not fixed... new features may be prioritized or not added without any notice ;-)
Feel free to request any roadmap change if you have any suggestion.

TODO: Add a warning or periodically ADIF export so data is backup
TODO: Create a function to look for QSO without a DXCC and ask the user to confirm the DXCC.
TODO: Isolate the QSO input tab and create a widget with it.
TODO: Isolate the Main QRZ box and create a widget with it.
TODO: Isolate the Awards tab and create a widget with it.
TODO: Add an option to save the DXCluster data to a file (file based on name or so)

TODO: Think if it is possible to create a function in the Widgets(i.e. MainWindowInputQSL) to read the data and
        enter it in the DB automatically when the user clicks on "enter"
        It would help to "isolate" it and make it more "independant"

TODO: Review the color management in MainWindowInputOthers::setIOTA (and maybe others) (completewithPrevious of MainWindow)
TODO: Check if in mainwindow (read formUI and modify the eQSL/LOTW REC/SENT values are correct

TODO: If no QSL sent via or rec via are defined, KLog shows as direct? It should be bureau



TODO: Add a cheking to the list of bureaus and propose the bureau for QSL via when there is an existing one and propose direct when no bureau is existing.
      (http://www.iaru.org/qsl-bureaus.html)

TODO: Define band limits for CW/SSB/RTTY... so when a click on the cluster is done, the right mode is proposed.
TODO: Add in the setup/Band/mode a combobox showing all the active band/modes so the user can select the default band/mode from that list.

BUG: Potential bug
Double click on a QSO in the log on the Mode/Band... you can modifify the value. As it is a double click, the QSO goes to edit and ...
Check if:
  - Only selected modes can be shown there.
  - If double click on the log we only "quick modify" directly in the log, without editing.

BUG: (TNX JL3OXR)
The DB is not storing if the time is stored in UTC or local so that info is lost.
If a user changes the configuration from time to time, the user will loose the real time when the QSO was made.
Solution:
 - Consider the DB is only storing UTC QSO.
 - Read config from user (or simply ask) and convert all the DB to UTC if needed (only one time when new version is installed to upgrade the DB)
 Always:
 - When entering data from the UI, check the user config and store only UTC time.
 - TODO: Think how to show the data in the log or search box as data is stored in UTC and showed directly (specially log widget)
    - Solution: Maybe changing the header to UTC may solve this and provide the info to the user that UTC is being used for storage
        It may be weird for the user to see the log in UTC when working in local time... in the rest of the functions...


TODO: void DXCCStatusWidget::slotRefreshButtonClicked()//TODO: Define a way to show the status of the selected log or all the logs in the DB

BUG: Optimize the KLog start

TODO: Add a tip on the DXCC Status showing some info: bearing, DXCC status (worked or not...)
TODO: Add a link or action on DXCCStatus items to doubleclick and search the QSOs that provide such status.

Clublog:
void MainWindow::slotQRZReturnPressed()
_x = elogClublog->deleteQSO(clublogPrevQSO);
_x = elogClublog->sendQSO(dataProxy->getClubLogRealTimeFromId(modifyingQSO))
It runs so fast and not serialized that at the end sometimes the QSO is deleted but not created afterwards

TODO: Sat Modes:
http://www.amsat.org/amsat/intro/sats_faq.html#RTFToC5
http://www.sckans.edu/~sireland/radio/amsat.html

A - This mode requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice.
B - This mode requires a 70 cm SSB/CW transmitter and a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. Some satellites also support RTTY and SSTV in this mode.
J -> V Uplink and U downlink
JA - This mode stands for J Analog and requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 70 cm SSB/CW receiver and supports CW, voice.
JD - This mode stands for J Digital and requires a 2 meter FM transmitter and a 70 cm SSB/CW receiver and supports packet.

K - This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. This mode is unique in that it can be done with a simple HF rig.
S - This mode requires a 70 cm SSB/CW transmitter and a 2.4 GHz SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. Many people use a 2.4 GHz to 2 meter converter with a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver instead of buying a 2.4 GHz SSB/CW receiver.
T - This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice.
KT, KA, BS, Some satellites have dual modes that operate simultaneously. For example, AO-13 can operate in mode BS which means that it can do both mode B and mode S simultaneously. Other common dual modes are KT and KA.
