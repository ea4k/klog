BUG: KLog needs to update the Entity DB is shown on every start

KLog should update ALWAYS when receiving from LoTW the QSL_LOTW_rcvd or add the QSO if not in local log.

Review the process after Setup

TODO: Add in the setup/Band/mode a combobox showing all the active band/modes so the user can select the default band/mode from that list.

BUG: Potential bug
Double click on a QSO in the log on the Mode/Band... you can modifify the value. As it is a double click, the QSO goes to edit and ...
Check if:
  - Only selected modes can be shown there.
  - If double click on the log we only "quick modify" directly in the log, without editing.

BUG: (TNX JL3OXR)
The DB is not storing if the time is stored in UTC or local so that info is lost.
If a user changes the configuration from time to time, the user will loose the real time when the QSO was made.
Solution:
 - Consider the DB is only storing UTC QSO.
 - Read config from user (or simply ask) and convert all the DB to UTC if needed (only one time when new version is installed to upgrade the DB)
 Always:
 - When entering data from the UI, check the user config and store only UTC time.
 - TODO: Think how to show the data in the log or search box as data is stored in UTC and showed directly (specially log widget)
    - Solution: Maybe changing the header to UTC may solve this and provide the info to the user that UTC is being used for storage
        It may be weird for the user to see the log in UTC when working in local time... in the rest of the functions...


TODO: void DXCCStatusWidget::slotRefreshButtonClicked()//TODO: Define a way to show the status of the selected log or all the logs in the DB

TODO: Sat Modes:
http://www.amsat.org/amsat/intro/sats_faq.html#RTFToC5
http://www.sckans.edu/~sireland/radio/amsat.html

A - This mode requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice.
B - This mode requires a 70 cm SSB/CW transmitter and a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. Some satellites also support RTTY and SSTV in this mode.
J -> V Uplink and U downlink
JA - This mode stands for J Analog and requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 70 cm SSB/CW receiver and supports CW, voice.
JD - This mode stands for J Digital and requires a 2 meter FM transmitter and a 70 cm SSB/CW receiver and supports packet.

K - This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. This mode is unique in that it can be done with a simple HF rig.
S - This mode requires a 70 cm SSB/CW transmitter and a 2.4 GHz SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. Many people use a 2.4 GHz to 2 meter converter with a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver instead of buying a 2.4 GHz SSB/CW receiver.
T - This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice.
KT, KA, BS, Some satellites have dual modes that operate simultaneously. For example, AO-13 can operate in mode BS which means that it can do both mode B and mode S simultaneously. Other common dual modes are KT and KA.
