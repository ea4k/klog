Follow these steps to build KLog.

KLog requires Qt5 to be built.

Currently, many distributions are still distributing Qt4 as a default Qt
version so it may be needed that you install Qt5 to be able to build KLog in
your system.

install may depend on your distribution, however, check for similar names &
versions and it will probably work :-)

If you have any suggestion for this file, please contact me. (Contact
details in the AUTHORS file).


1. Install the KLog dependencies

        - Install g++, make, qt5-qmake, qtbase5-dev, qttools5-dev, libqt5charts5-dev, libqt5sql5-sqlite, libqt5serialport5-dev & libhamlib-dev packages

In Debian it is done with: apt-get install g++ make qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev libqt5charts5-dev libqt5sql5-sqlite libhamlib-dev libqt5serialport5-dev

In your distribution, you should know how to install new packages :-)


Make sure you have qt5 available. You can do it with the qtchooser command.
The output should be something like:

        user@debian:~$ qtchooser -l
        4
        5
        default
        qt4-i386-linux-gnu
        qt4
        qt5-i386-linux-gnu
        qt5
        user@debian:~$


It should return the list of qt versions available, qt5 must be one of them.
If qt5 is still not there, check your instalallation as one of the previous packages may be missing.

2.- Select the appropriate Qt version (Qt5)

    export QT_SELECT=qt5

3.- Untar klog

    tar xvzf klog-version.tar.gz

    enter the KLog directory

    cd klog-version


4.- Generate the Makefile

    qmake PREFIX=/usr/local src.pro

5. Make everything.

    make

If everything goes OK, you should have the klog executable in the folder.

6.- To install KLog, execute the following from the root account.

    make install

Now you are done. Just execute klog and enjoy!
