# Reporting Security Issues

The KLog team and community take security bugs in KLog seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please communicate with the KLog project owner.

The KLog team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party libraries to the person or team maintaining the library. 

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 10 business days, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the KLog Telegram group.

## The KLog Security Notification Process

KLog notifications are done in the Telegram channels.
