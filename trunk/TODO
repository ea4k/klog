TODO: Add the tr() in the startwizard.cpp to the QString gplLic about the CTY download

This is a kind of roadmap for KLog development.
It is not fixed... new features may be prioritized or not added without any notice ;-)
Feel free to request any roadmap change if you have any suggestion.


BUG: Check the options that are marked in QSL when rightbutton.
i.e.: Is myQSL sent marked as requested when it should be the DX-QSL?





TODO GUI: To add the CQ/ITU box or make them editable

BUG:
Clublog:
void MainWindow::slotQRZReturnPressed()
_x = elogClublog->deleteQSO(clublogPrevQSO);
_x = elogClublog->sendQSO(dataProxy->getClubLogRealTimeFromId(modifyingQSO))
It runs so fast and not serialized that at the end sometimes the QSO is deleted but not created afterwards


<CLUBLOG>
TODO: Add the possibility to the user to select from the setup a call to be used in clublog or use the one comming from the station callsign lineedit
TODO: In slotQsoUploadFinished, if QSO is not uploaded. mark it as not uploaded in the log

If qsoToEdit, nothing is modified and OK. (Clublog returns QSO DUPE)
Again qsoToEdit, nothing is modified and OK (Clublogs returns QSO DROPPED, and QSO is dropped!)

TODO: Check the values that clublog is returning to manage errors and show messages to the user
TODO: To add the possibility to upload a modified QSO to clublog.

<SATELLITE SUPPORT>
TODO: Add Satellite support (maybe another Tab) (look this file (below) for details.
TODO: Satellite name QLineEdit mask "Aaa-900" (check how the ISS is named to see if it would match... does not match!!!)
TODO: Add satellite input fields (in the others input Tab?)
TODO: Sats: https://www.eqsl.cc/qslcard/ADIFContentSpecs.cfm
TODO: Sats: https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw/faq#sats
TODO: Sat Modes:
http://www.amsat.org/amsat/intro/sats_faq.html#RTFToC5
http://www.sckans.edu/~sireland/radio/amsat.html

A - This mode requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice.
B - This mode requires a 70 cm SSB/CW transmitter and a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. Some satellites also support RTTY and SSTV in this mode.
J -> V Uplink and U downlink
JA - This mode stands for J Analog and requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 70 cm SSB/CW receiver and supports CW, voice.
JD - This mode stands for J Digital and requires a 2 meter FM transmitter and a 70 cm SSB/CW receiver and supports packet.

K - This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. This mode is unique in that it can be done with a simple HF rig.
S - This mode requires a 70 cm SSB/CW transmitter and a 2.4 GHz SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice. Many people use a 2.4 GHz to 2 meter converter with a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver instead of buying a 2.4 GHz SSB/CW receiver.
T - This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 2 meter SSB/CW receiver and supports CW and voice.
KT, KA, BS, Some satellites have dual modes that operate simultaneously. For example, AO-13 can operate in mode BS which means that it can do both mode B and mode S simultaneously. Other common dual modes are KT and KA.

Mode V
Mode U
Mode U/V -> B
