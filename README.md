The objective of KLog is to provide a free software that runs in GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.
KLog provides general purpose Hamradio DX logging support.

### IMPORTANT:
All the mailing lists, code and releases have been removed from Savannah and they are no longer available.
I will wait some days to see if they can be recovered before looking for another place to host all the needed services.
